About This Repository
=====================

This is a repository of my models, data and scripts forming solutions 
to the end-of-chapter exercises in The AMPL Book, along with occasional 
learning notes and related commentaries I make as I progress through the 
book.

I recently joined AMPL Optimization, Inc. in a sales and marketing 
capacity and want to subject myself to the same learning experience that 
many AMPL users have when first exposed to mathematical optimization and 
AMPL, more often than not during a university course on the subject.




The AMPL Book
=============

The book, written by Robert Fourer, David M. Gay and Brian W. Kernighan 
is a "comprehensive guide to building optimization models, for beginning 
or experienced users", as per the book's webpage at: 

	http://ampl.com/resources/the-ampl-book/

The book is available for download at the link above, along with all the 
models, data and scripts that comprise the in-chapter examples (but not 
the end-of-chapter exercises).




About AMPL - A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming
=============================================================

From the LinkedIn page of AMPL Optimization, Inc. at:

	https://www.linkedin.com/company/ampl ...

"AMPL is a comprehensive and powerful algebraic modeling language for 
linear and nonlinear optimization problems, in discrete or continuous 
variables.

Developed at Bell Laboratories, AMPL lets you use common notation and 
familiar concepts to formulate optimization models and examine solutions, 
while the computer manages communication with an appropriate solver.

AMPL's flexibility and convenience render it ideal for rapid prototyping 
and model development, while its speed and control options make it an 
especially efficient choice for repeated production runs."

DISCLAIMERS
===========

I make this available because it may be useful to folks who are diving 
into mathematical programming, optimization and AMPL, but I do so WITHOUT 
ANY WARRANTY, and without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Furthermore, whilst I progress through chapters sequentially and address 
every exercise in the book, I do not present this as a complete or even 
correct set of solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises. 

I will however indicate the places where I extend models and data which I 
find interesting beyond the intended scope of the exercises, or include 
new work for the sake of experimentation.




About Branching & Notes
=======================

Where the book requires (or I experiment with) varied iterations on the 
same model, data, etc, I branch the code off into new branches named after 
the Chapter and Exercise. 

However, for ease of access to my notes, I maintain one note file per 
chapter titled 'CHAPTER NOTES.md' which lives in the master branch. This 
way, reading my notes on sequential problem iterations can be done without 
needing to flip between code branches.




Getting AMPL, the IDE and Solvers
=================================

A working demo of AMPL complete with IDE and demo licenses of a number of 
popular solvers is available at:
